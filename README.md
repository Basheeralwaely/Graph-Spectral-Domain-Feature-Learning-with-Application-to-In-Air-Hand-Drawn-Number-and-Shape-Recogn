# Graph-Spectral-Domain-Feature-Learning-with-Application-to-In-Air-Hand-Drawn-Number-and-Shape-Recogn
This data set contains in-air hand-written numbers and shapes data used in the paper "Graph Spectral Features for In-Air Hand-Drawn Number and Shape Recognition" submitted to IEEE Trans. Multimedia submitted in November 2018.

This data set contains the following:
-Readme.txt
- InAirNumberShapeDataset.zip containing
-Number Folder (With 2 sub folders for Matlab and Excel)
-Shapes Folder (With 2 sub folders for Matlab and Excel)

The data sets include the in-air drawn number and shape hand movement path captured by a Kinect sensor. The number sub dataset includes 500 instances per each number 0 to 9, resulting in a total of 5000 number data instances. Similarly, the shape sub dataset also includes 500 instances per each shape for 10 different arbitrary 2D shapes, resulting in a total of 5000 shape instances. The data set provides X, Y, Z coordinates of the hand movement path data in Matlab (M-file) and Excel formats and their corresponding labels. 

This dataset creation has received The University of Sheffield ethics approval under application #023005 granted on 19/10/2018.
